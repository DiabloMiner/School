        // Essential features
            // TODO: Engine: Why would objects later in time be updated to this timeStep? ; Should now be updated properly but has to be tested
        // TODO: Test billard / Proceed to multibody collisions

        // Optional features
        // TODO: Implement Loader
        // TODO: Implement LCP
        // TODO: Improve willCollide for collisions without forces
        // TODO: Maybe redo some texture maps ; Maybe add in enums for every texture parameter
        // TODO: Introduce array with a maxsize in shaders so dynamic arrays are possible --> Fully implement Normal mapping (more effective)
        // TODO: Optimize VBO usage ; Review assimp code ; Rewrite the geometry shaders into for loops in the linux version
        // TODO: Better Bloom ; Implement curved surfaces rendering ; Implement reflection probes (with retroreflection) as classes
        // TODO: Maybe improve Material hashing function

        // Added functionality:
        // Implemented directional shadow casting for directional lights and spot lights ; Added dynamic yaw and pitch calculation ; Implemented omnidirectional shadow casting ;
        // Removed standard point light cube from shadow maps ; Introduced abstract Engine class ; Abstract things that are currently solved with public static lists into managers so multiple can be had
        // Made it possible to add skyboxes ; Replaced clear function in SingleFramebufferRenderer with CubeMap ; Wrote a skybox class ; Created textures only used for models ; Created a mesh and model super class
        // Implemented a list for static shaderprograms ; Implemented skybox manager ; Camera controls at beginning are right way around now ; Replaced the generic renderable light in LightManager with specific functions
        // Created new textures explicitly used for multisampling ; Rethought FramebufferTextures: Textures are now a filed of FramebufferTextures ; Shadows are now not distorted by resizing
        // Fixed a problem with the gold cube creating false reflections through mistakenly gamma-corrected normals ; Managers (RenderableManager) are not passed into constructors anymore: Narrowed definition for stored objects for RenderableManager
        // Made changes so only basic components are allowed public static sets used for deleting them ;  Code in BlurRenderer:getFinalFramebuffer() has been replaced with modulo code
        // Removed unnecessary throwsShadows variable in Renderable ; Introduced static renderables ; Changed PingPongQuad to a startingvalue system to avoid having to localize the current event system to rendering engines
        // Removed unnecessary renderers list in RenderingEngine ; FramebufferManager is not passed to BlurRenderer in its constructor anymore & Added some code to prevent resizing difficulties
        // Removed all public static sets/lists for base components except textures ;  Used the provided mesh/texture list in AssimpModel instead of specialized lists ; Rewrote framebuffer class to more closely match OpenGL
        // Implemented a sort of I/O-Engine ; Introduced enums for OpenGL integer parameters ; Fixed some strange camera behaviour by normalising the right direction ; Implemented a texture safeguard preventing failure if a texture in the middle of alreadyBound was unbound
        // Minimized the number of OpenGL calls by about 75%(200x->476) by binding textures initially, introducing rendering flags and removing unnecessary re-/unbinding (e.g. vertexAttribPointers)
        // Added JBlas initialization to prevent lag spikes during collision resolution ; After checkForCollision performTimeStep should be skipped ; After collision all objects should be updated to same time and then timestep should be changed
        // Maybe implement timesteps outside of collisions that are RK2: When there wont be a collision in a rk2 timesteps it performs rk2 ; Implemented an index to prevent double collision checks;
        // Nearest point functions for more shapes have to be implemented: Normal tests, distance and closest points: Slow for nonpolyhedral objects though ; Implement static/dynamic objects as enum (dont check for static-static collisions)
        // Removed updateInertiaMatrix, because the functionality has essentially been replaced by objecttype ; Shadow values were moved into RenderComponent ; Decided on differentiating between render components(added from the engine) and renderables
        // Implemented a material system for different coefficients
